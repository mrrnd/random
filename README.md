	- `mapping(uint => uint) internal tickets` - tickets for the current draw;
	- `mapping(uint => bool) internal payed_back` - ticket payment refunding identifier;
	- `address[] public addr` - addresses of all the draw participants;
	- `uint32 public random_num` - draw serial number;
	- `uint public liveBlocksNumber` - amount of blocks untill the lottery ending;
	- `uint public startBlockNumber` - initial block of the current lottery;
	- `uint public endBlockNumber` - final block of the current lottery;
	- `uint public constant onePotWei = 10000000000000000` - 1 ticket cost is 0.01 ETH;
	- `address public inv_contract` - investing contract;

- Events. This generates a public events on the blockchain that will notify clients:
	- `event Buy(address indexed sender, uint eth)`
	tickets purchase
	- `event Withdraw(address indexed sender, address to, uint eth)`
	reward accruing
	- `event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint value)`
	sending ticket to another address
	- `event TransferError(address indexed to, uint value); // event (error)
	sending ETH from the contract was failed


- Modifiers:
	- `modifier onlyManager()`
	methods with following modifier can only be called by the manager
